Independence where he suffered a gunshot wound to the leg in 1919. Grace was
also active in the Anti-Treaty IRA during the Civil War. However, he was unable
to carry out an occupation after 1923 and by the 1930s was in poor physical and
mental health, spending a period in Grangegorman mental institution in 1944.
