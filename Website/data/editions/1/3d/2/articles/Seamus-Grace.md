Fighting alongside Malone at 25 Northumberland Road was Seamus Grace (1888-1959)
who was also a volunteer serving in C Company. A native of Dublin, Grace worked
as a General Clerk at the College of Surgeons (NAI, 1911 census returns). He
joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1912, where he attended meetings and
was issued a .22 caliber pistol. In August of 1913, Grace left Ireland for
America. Before leaving, he was given the credentials for Clan na Gael- a
republican organization in the States. To his regret, he lost these credentials
and consequently, after eighteen months, moved to Canada where he joined the
Canadian army. It was there that he learned how to shoot a rifle. 

After three months in the army, British agents began to make inquiries into his
activities. A letter written by a colleague in the IRB in Gaelic was sent to
Grace within which was written: “we’re waiting for you”. Taking this as an
opportunity for escape, Grace packed his back and departed for Dublin
immediately.
