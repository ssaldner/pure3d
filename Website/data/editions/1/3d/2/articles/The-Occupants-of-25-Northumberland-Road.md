# Confrontation at Beggars Bush Barracks

Before occupying the building, three men who were later to occupy 25
Northumberland Road, Seamus Grace, Paddy Rowe, and Michael Byrne were ordered to
guard the gates of Beggars Bush barracks on nearby Haddington Road. While
guarding the gates, they were approached by an elderly man and his son. The man
asked to examine Rowe’s rifle. Rowe, stepping back, refused to relinquish the
weapon. The man took a few steps towards Rowe and even attempted to snatch the
rifle from his grip. At this point, Grace pointed the bayonet of his rifle at
the man’s throat and instructed him to leave.

Tensions boiled over, and the man pulled a revolver from his breast pocket,
aiming it at Grace and was about to pull the trigger when Grace laid the blade
of his bayonet against the man’s throat. It was at this point that the younger
man accompanying him jumped between Seamus and his companion, exclaiming “it's
alright, Sergeant, don't shoot my father”. Grace would later come to discover
that the man was a member of a pro-British part-time, largely middle-aged,
territorial organization called the Gorgeous Wrecks, who were instructed to
disarm as many Irish volunteers as possible.

Soon thereafter, the men were authorized to proceed to their post whereupon they
began to convert 25 Northumberland Road into a defensible position, putting up
barricades and constructing other obstructive elements.
