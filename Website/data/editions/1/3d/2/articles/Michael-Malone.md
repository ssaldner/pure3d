Michael Malone (1888-1916) was the commanding officer in charge of C Company’s
defence of Northumberland Road, and a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion of the
Irish Volunteers. Born in Dublin, Malone was a carpenter who had won prizes in
art and drawing from the Technical Schools. A devout Catholic, he was a member
of St Patrick’s Confraternity in Ringsend, Dublin (Catholic Bulletin, 1916).
Described as ‘the crack shot of his Company’. 

He was described by Seamus Grace, who occupied 25 Northumberland Road with him
during the battle, to have been “a fine well-built young man with good features,
serious minded but with an excellent sense of humour, but when the occasion
arose could be a very strict disciplinarian”. He was one of the few Volunteers
who had a handgun during the Battle.
