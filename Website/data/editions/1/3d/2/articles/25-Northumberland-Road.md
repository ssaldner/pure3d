25 Northumberland Road, a three-storey, Victorian terraced townhouse on the
corner of the junction with Haddington Road, was the most southerly building
occupied by C Company. The building was the home of Michael Cussen, described by
Grace as ‘friendly’, who had evacuated his family and servants in advance of the
Rising (DCLA, Dublin City Electoral Rolls, 1914; Thom’s Directory, 1916; MAI,
BMH WS 310).

C Company had no way of knowing which routes the British would take into the
city centre, but if the British decided that one of their routes would be along
the Coast Road, 25 Northumberland Road would be the first point where they met
Irish Resistance.
