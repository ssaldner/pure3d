<h1>Dick Murphy</h1><p><img src="../media/Richard_Murphy.jpeg" width="200" style="float: right;" hspace="15px"></p><p>Richard ‘Dick’ Murphy (c. 1892-1916), member, B Company, 3rd Battalion, Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers. Born in Dublin, the second eldest son of eight children who survived to adulthood (eleven children were born to his parents), Murphy trained for a career as a tailor. In 1911 he was living with his parents and siblings in South William Street in the centre of the city, but by 1916 was set to be married having secured a ‘modest house’. He had, apparently, deferred the wedding to care for his widowed mother but had arranged to marry within a week when the Easter Rising broke out (NAI, 1911 census returns; Catholic Bulletin, 1917). Having originally joined the main contingent of the 3rd Battalion in Boland’s Bakery under Éamon de Valera on Easter Monday, Murphy was one of the men sent by Simon Donnelly, commandant of C Company, to reinforce the small garrison in Clanwilliam House on Wednesday morning. The last rebel post to fall during the Battle of Mount Street Bridge, the house sustained continued assault before eventually catching fire. Murphy was killed by rifle fire and was seen to have died in his fighting position, still holding his rifle. He was one of three members of the garrison to die in the fighting, and his body was incinerated by the flames that engulfed Clanwilliam House and never recovered (Catholic Bulletin, 1917; MAI, BMH WS 127; MAI, BMH WS 309; MAI, BMH WS 198).</p>
