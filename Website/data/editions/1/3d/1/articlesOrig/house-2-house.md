# House to House Searching

Once 25 Northumberland Road had been occupied, British troops began house to
house searches along Northumberland Road, as they were uncertain as to which
buildings the Irish troops occupied. As they made their towards Clanwilliam
House, there was painfully little cover for the British soldiers. ’Those that
managed to get under cover of the bridge, both from Northumberland Road and
Percy Place, now attempted to cross the Bridge, led by an officer. They charged
in small groups of about 8-12, but they did not succeed. They went down on the
Bridge again, and again they made the attempt, but did not survive. By now there
was a great pile of dead and dying on the Bridge’.
