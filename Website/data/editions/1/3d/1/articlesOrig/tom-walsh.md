Thomas Walsh (1899-1970), member, B Company, 3rd Battalion, Dublin Brigade of
the Irish Volunteers. Born in Dublin in 1894, and the eldest of six children who
survived to adulthood, Walsh trained as a carpet layer. His father was a coal
factor and his parents ran a greengrocer’s from the family home in East James’s
Street in the city. Walsh joined a company of the Irish Volunteers in Sandymount
shortly after their formation in November 1913; his brother James soon joined
the same company. It was after the split with the supporters of John Redmond in
1914 that Thomas and James Walsh joined B Company, 3rd Battalion. Between 1914
and 1916, the Walshs and their father assisted in the transportation of arms for
the Irish Volunteers. (MAI, BMH WS 198; NAI, 1911 census returns). Thomas and
James Walsh spent the majority of their service in the Irish Volunteers and
Irish Republican Army (IRA) together.

On Easter Monday 1916, Thomas Walsh and his brother joined the rebels in
Boland’s Bakery under Éamon de Valera. The following day, they were dispatched
to Westland Row train station and on returning were informed that they would be
among four men being sent to reinforce the garrison in Clanwilliam House. Both
took part in the defence of Clanwilliam House and remained inside until its fall
on Wednesday evening. Thomas was briefly knocked unconscious by his Mauser rifle
after firing it for the first time on Wednesday afternoon. Having escaped from
the burning Clanwilliam House, he encountered opposition from locals in Mount
Street, whom he threatened with his revolver, and was forced to seek shelter.
Unable to return to Boland’s, Walsh spent the rest of the Rising in hiding in
halls and houses around the Baggot Street area. He and his brother remained on
the run in the homes of family and friends, including a period together in the
Beaumont Convalescent Home, until December 1916 (MAI, BMH WS 198; MAI, MSPR
34/REF/8975).

Thomas Walsh remained active in the republican movement after 1916. He served as
a company transport officer during the War of Independence and the family home
was used as an arms dump. He was on active service as a cyclist during ‘Bloody
Sunday’ 1920 and later claimed that he had offered his services to the
anti-Treaty IRA during the Civil War but had never been called to take part in
armed action (MAI, MSPR MSPR 34/REF/8975). Walsh was married with two sons and
two daughters.

Thomas Walsh died on 2 December 1970 (Irish Times, 4 Dec. 1970).
