Patrick (Paddy) Doyle (c. 1880-1916), adjutant, E company, 3rd Battalion, Dublin
Brigade of the Irish Volunteers. Doyle was born in Dundrum, County Dublin, and
was living in Milltown and working as a labourer in 1916. A devout Catholic and
member of the Gaelic League, Doyle was a member of the Milltown Temperance and
Sacred Heart Sodalities, said the rosary daily in Milltown Church, and taught
Irish classes in the area. By 1916 he was married and the father to five young
children (Catholic Bulletin, 1916). Having originally joined the main contingent
of the 3rd Battalion in Boland’s Bakery under Éamon de Valera on Easter Monday,
Doyle was sent by Simon Donnelly, commandant of C Company, to reinforce the
small garrison in Clanwilliam House on Wednesday morning. The last rebel post to
fall during the Battle of Mount Street Bridge, the house sustained continued
assault before eventually catching fire. Doyle was killed by rifle fire, one of
three members of the garrison to die in the fighting, and his body was
incinerated by the flames that engulfed Clanwilliam House and never recovered
(MAI, BMH WS 127; MAI, BMH WS 309; MAI, BMH WS 198). On Easter Monday he had
written a short note to his wife: ‘Sarah, all well, do not fret, will be
alright’ (NLI, Ms. 46,594). One of Doyle’s sons was killed fighting with the
National Army during the Civil War (MAI, MSPR W/2D50).
