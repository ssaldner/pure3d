# Heavy British Casualties

Sometime after 6.00 pm, the 2/8th Sherwood Foresters, which has been in the rear
on the march from Kingstown, made several attempts to take Clanwilliam House,
suffering heavy casualties. The first of these attempts was by B Company.. it
was led by Lieutenant Daffen down the left side of Northumberland Road He was
shot and killed, along with 2nd Lieut. Browne, who died of his wounds a few days
later. 

(Sherwood Foresters p. 40)

The Regimental History of the 2.8th describes what happened next: ‘These
Officers had been accompanied by Lieut. Hewitt and his scouts who were now
reduced to two, and by Lieut. C. P. Elliott with what was left of his platoon.
The latter also was severely wounded on the Bridge, and Lieut. Hewitt taking
cover at the South Wed Corner of the Bridge, endeavoured, with the aid of his
scouts to discount, by rapid fire on the windows of Clanwilliam House, the
accuracy of the enemy's aim.’

B Company ‘as a fighting unit had practically ceased to exist, all its Officers,
its Sergeant Major and all the Sergeants being either killed or wounded.’ 

(Sherwood Foresters p. 40-41)
