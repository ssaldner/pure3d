# Thomas Walsh Describes the Sherwood Foresters Progression

'On looking towards Percy Place, I discovered several of the enemy looking for
cover. I fired again and again until the rifle heated so much it was impossible
to hold it. . . . 

From . . . [the front of the house] we could see terrible confusion among the
enemy. They were being attacked from Northumberland Road, held by Mick Malone
and Jimmy Grace.

Those who managed to get by “25” ran towards the Bridge and took cover anywhere
they could find it, on house steps, behind trees, and even in the channels of
the roadway. We kept on blazing away at those in the channels, and after a time
as they were killed, the next fellow moved up and passed the man killed, in
front of him. This gave one the impression of a giant human khaki - coloured
caterpillar. . . .'
