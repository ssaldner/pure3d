# The Last Holdout

Clanwilliam House was the last of the rebel posts to fall following a concerted
rush by troops from the 2/8th and 2/7th Sherwood Foresters during which the
house caught fire. Both Irish and British sources agreed as to the timing of the
fall of the house, somewhere between around 9.30-10.30 at night. Three of the
seven men occupying Clanwilliam House died in the battle: George Reynolds, Paddy
Doyle and Richard Murphy. The others escaped through the back basement window.
The Walsh brothers along with William Ronan escaped to continue fighting.
James Doyle went in another direction, was wounded, but carried to safety. He
managed to escape down the country after the Rising where he remained until
Christmas 1916. 

The badly damaged building remained unoccupied after the Rising until it
collapsed during a storm in 1920.
