# Preparedness of the British Troops

Seven companies of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment, popularly known as
the Sherwood Foresters, followed the tram route on the Coast Road into Dublin
city centre (four of the forward column, the 2/7th, and three from the rear
column, the 2/8th). There were approximately 1,750 soldiers between the two
battalions. The soldiers were being trained to fight in the open fields of the
Western Front, and had between approximately three to eight months of training,
depending on when they joined the Regiment. They were not trained for the city
fighting or fighting in a built-up environment (as no British solder was at the
time) that they would encounter in Dublin. The battalions had never been in an
operational environment and urban warfare was not included in the training for
units earmarked for service on the Western Front.

The Sherwood Foresters were armed with the Short Magazine Lee-Enfield (SMLE),
Mark III rifle which fired a .303 inch calibre round; each man was issued with
120 rounds of ammunition, which should have been enough for an engagement such
as the Battle of Mount Street Bridge. The Battalions’ Lewis Guns (automatic
machine guns) were left in Liverpool. The reason for this is unclear. The
Regimental History of the 2/7th indicates that it might have been because there
was not enough space on the boat for them. But the Regimental History of the
2/8th indicates that the reason the guns were left behind was that ‘men were
wanted and not guns’.
