# Volunteer Positions

By Wednesday, April 26, Clanwilliam House had a garrison of seven men as a last
line of defense for holding Mount Street Bridge against the British trying to
take Trinity College in the city center. These men were Commanding Officer
George Reynolds, Adjunct Patrick 'Paddy' Doyle and Company Members Richard
'Dick' Murphy, William 'Willy' Ronan, James Joseph Doyle and brothers Thomas
Walsh and James Walsh.

Their relative positions in the building changed over the course of their
occupation and defense. However, Thomas Walsh gave a detailed account of the
battle from his recollections in which he also named initial assigned positions
of the seven men. George Reynolds, Paddy Doyle and Dick Murphy each had a window
on the first floor facing the canal and Northumberland Road, Willy Ronan and
James Doyle were stationed on the second floor just above them and the Walsh
brothers were posted to the first and second floor rear windows that faced
south-west.
