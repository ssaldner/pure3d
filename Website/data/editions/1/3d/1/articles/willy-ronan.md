William Ronan (or Rownan) (1889-1965), member, C Company, 3rd Battalion, Dublin
Brigade of the Irish Volunteers. Ronan was born in Dublin to Kilkenny parents
and was the eldest of three children surviving to adulthood. He trained as a
paper-cutter and in 1911 was living with his parents in Longford Street, Dublin
(NAI, 1911 census returns). He joined the Irish Volunteers in August 1914 (MAI,
MSPR WDP/6415-2).

Ronan was one of the men who, under Section Commander George Reynolds, occupied
Clanwilliam House on Easter Monday 1916. Ronan remained there until the fall of
the house at the end of the battle on Wednesday, when he escaped. He was
arrested the following day and imprisoned in England until August 1916. It was
later claimed that Ronan was severely beaten by a soldier in Kilmainham Gaol
after his arrest and suffered poor health afterwards. (MAI, MSPR 34/E/5552,
WDP/6415-2).

Ronan was later active in the IRA in Dublin during the War of Independence,
though in an intelligence and auxiliary capacity owing to his nervous state.
During the Civil War he participated on the Anti-Treaty side and was interned in
1923. Ronan married in 1918 and had three children but spent his last decades in
mental institutions suffering from ‘delusional insanity attributable to military
service’. Ronan was a patient in St Brendan’s, Grangegorman from 1933 to 1938
and then St. Ita’s, Donabate until his death on 8 September 1965 (MAI, MSPR,
34/E/5552, WDP/6415-1, WDP/6415-2, W1/RB/1962).

WIlliam Ronan is buried in Deansgrange Cemetery.
