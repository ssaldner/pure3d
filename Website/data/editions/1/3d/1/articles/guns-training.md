# Guns and Training

The Irish volunteers had very little training and for some this was their first
time firing a gun. For example, Thomas Walsh recounts his first shot during the
battle in which he was knocked out because of the blow-back to his chin. He says
he was fore-warned of this but had forgotten. 

In addition to verbal instruction on firing the guns, the volunteers were given
instructions for prepping their positions once they took possession of a
building. They were to smash the glass in the windows and barricade any openings
with furniture and coal. 

While at Clanwilliam, furniture and coal was used as barricades the window glass
was not smashed. This was not done because, upon seizure of the building,
Commanding Officer George Reynolds had promised the owner of the house that he
would return the building in it's original condition. 

In the house, there was reportedly: four Lee Enfield’s, two Martini rifles, two
Howth Mauser, two .38 and .45 revolvers, a .38 automatic and about 2,000
rounds." The Irish Press, 26 April 1956, p. 7.

Unfortunately, some of these rounds were meant for a newer version of the
martini-enfield. James Doyle stated in his witness statement that ‘we had very
little VI and he [Reynolds] was afraid that the VII would be too heavy on our
martini rifles.’ (BMH.WS0309, p.4) Sometime later, Doyle’s rifle exploded from
repeated use of VII ammunition.
