<h1>Sherwood Forester Leadership</h1><p>The Sherwood Foresters Brigade was overseen by Brigadier General Ernest Maconchy, and the 2/7th Robin Hood Rifles by Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Fane, assisted by Second-in-Command Major F. Rayner and Adjutant Captain Dietrichsen.&nbsp;</p><p>The soldiers under their command were highly inexperienced and many had not yet completed their basic training. As such, they were heavily dependent upon a rigid hierarchy of command to maintain morale and carry out orders. The officers would be singled out by the Irish volunteers, leading to confusion and delay.</p><p><table class="image" width="538" style="display: block; margin: auto">
