</table><p>Despite the fact that the British Army had been making preparations to divert troops towards Ireland for ‘Home Defense' when Patrick Pearse read out the Proclamation of the Irish Republic on Monday, 24 April 1916, the British were caught off guard. Shortly after the Proclamation was read, London was made aware of the uprising and&nbsp; before the end of the day, British troops in northeast England were&nbsp;mobilised to supplement those already stationed in Ireland to suppress the unrest.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the troops mobilised were two battalions of the Sherwood Foresters, the 2/7th, (the Robin Hoods’)&nbsp; and the 2/8th.&nbsp; They departed by train for Liverpool on the morning of the 25th, and in the evening sailed to the Irish port of Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire). Many of the enlisted&nbsp; men and even some of the officers did not know their intended destination. </p><p>When the order for mobilisation was received, many of the Foresters were recruits still in training. Additionally, the training they had received was for the trench warfare common to&nbsp; the Western Front, which was to prove&nbsp; inadequate for the situation they found themselves in in Dublin, fighting in a built-up area&nbsp; or urban warfare.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>(Papadopoulos &amp; Schreibman, 2019; Maconchy, 1920). </p>
