[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)


# About
This repository contains software and documentation for Pure3D, an infrastructure and conceptual framework for publishing, depositing and exploring 3D worlds and objects.

The work is the product of the [Pure3D project](https://pure3d.eu). 

When finished, it will run on infrastructure of the [KNAW/Humanities Cluster](https://huc.knaw.nl), conforming to [CLARIAH](https://github.com/CLARIAH/clariah-plus) specifications.

[DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/nl/) is overseeing that Pure3D supports the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

# Documentation
Technical documentation is in the [docs](https://github.com/CLARIAH/pure3d/blob/main/docs/index.md).

See in particular

* a [set of pilots](https://github.com/CLARIAH/pure3d/blob/main/docs/pilots/voyager.md)
  showing how we tame the Smithsonian Voyager, a 3D viewer in Javascript, and use it in an ordinary
  webserver-client context.
* a [roundtrip](https://github.com/CLARIAH/pure3d/blob/main/docs/pilots/roundtrip.md)
  showing how you can edit a model in voyager-story and then can see the changes in voyager-explorer,
  both served by the same webapp.
